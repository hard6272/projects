Comments for programming assignment 3
Project used camera gadged, found in chapter 7, page 154-155.

Line 62: Missing “;” after “theColours.addEventListener ('click', function(e){showTeaVerdict(e.source.TeaColour)”
<br>
Line 90: Missing “,” after “error: function (e) {alert('There was a problem accessing the camer’)}”
<br>
Line 90: “camera” spelled as “camer”
<br>
Line 92: missing “})”. Must be separate set before final “});”, moved to line 93.
<br>
Lines 87-93: After changes, although formatting is identical to the code found in the book, error is given stating “missing semicolon” for lines 87, 91, and 92. 

After several attempts at punctuation/structure change, application hangs at red loading screen, will not run. Code looks satisfactory, but until code can be simulated, there is no clear answer. Would recommend removing extra spaces between lines, and using “//“ only when necessary to separate sets of functions.
